  ## Introduction

  In this guide, you will learn how to:

  - Create Docker volumes when starting containers.
  - Use the `--mount` and `-v` flags to mount volumes into containers.

  Docker volumes are essential for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. They are the preferred method for managing data in Docker containers.

  ## Step 1: Start a Container with a Volume Using `--mount` Flag

  The `--mount` flag is the newer and more verbose way to specify volume mounts in Docker. It provides a clearer syntax and more options than the `-v` flag.

  ### Single-Line Format

  ```bash
  # Start a container with a named volume using the --mount flag
  docker run --name volume-demo1 -p 8090:80 --mount type=volume,source=myvol101,target=/myapps -d nginx:alpine-slim
  ```

  ### Readable Format

  ```bash
  docker run \
      --name volume-demo1 \
      -p 8090:80 \
      --mount type=volume,source=myvol101,target=/myapps \
      -d \
      nginx:alpine-slim
  ```

  **Explanation:**

  - `--mount type=volume,source=myvol101,target=/myapps`:
    - `type=volume`: Specifies that we're mounting a Docker volume.
    - `source=myvol101`: The name of the Docker volume to use. If it doesn't exist, Docker will create it.
    - `target=/myapps`: The directory inside the container where the volume will be mounted.

  **Verify the Container and Volume Mount**

  ```bash
  # List Docker Containers
  docker ps

  # Format the output for clarity
  docker ps --format "table {{.Image}}\t{{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.ID}}\t{{.Ports}}"

  # Connect to the container
  docker exec -it volume-demo1 /bin/sh

  # Inside the container, check the mounted volumes
  df -h

  # Navigate to the mounted directory
  cd /myapps

  # List contents (should be empty initially)
  ls

  # Exit the container shell
  exit
  ```

  **Inspect the Docker Container**

  ```bash
  # Inspect the container's mounts
  docker inspect volume-demo1

  # Extract just the Mounts information in JSON format
  docker inspect --format='{{json .Mounts}}' volume-demo1

  # For better readability, pipe the output to 'jq' (JSON processor)
  docker inspect --format='{{json .Mounts}}' volume-demo1 | jq
  ```

  **Expected Output:**

  - The `Mounts` section should show that `myvol101` is mounted to `/myapps` inside the container.
  - Inside the container, the `/myapps` directory corresponds to the Docker volume `myvol101`.

  ---

  ## Step 2: Start a Container with a Volume Using `-v` Flag

  The `-v` or `--volume` flag is the older syntax for mounting volumes. It is still widely used and works well for simple volume mounts.

  ### Single-Line Format

  ```bash
  # Start a container with a named volume using the -v flag
  docker run --name volume-demo2 -p 8091:80 -v myvol102:/myapps -d nginx:alpine-slim
  ```

  ### Readable Format

  ```bash
  docker run \
      --name volume-demo2 \
      -p 8091:80 \
      -v myvol102:/myapps \
      -d \
      nginx:alpine-slim
  ```

  **Explanation:**

  - `-v myvol102:/myapps`:
    - `myvol102`: The name of the Docker volume to use. If it doesn't exist, Docker will create it.
    - `/myapps`: The directory inside the container where the volume will be mounted.

  **Verify the Container and Volume Mount**

  ```bash
  # List Docker Containers
  docker ps

  # Format the output for clarity
  docker ps --format "table {{.Image}}\t{{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.ID}}\t{{.Ports}}"

  # Connect to the container
  docker exec -it volume-demo2 /bin/sh

  # Inside the container, check the mounted volumes
  df -h

  # Navigate to the mounted directory
  cd /myapps

  # List contents (should be empty initially)
  ls

  # Exit the container shell
  exit
  ```

  **Expected Output:**

  - The `Mounts` section (viewable via `docker inspect volume-demo2`) should show that `myvol102` is mounted to `/myapps` inside the container.
  - Inside the container, the `/myapps` directory corresponds to the Docker volume `myvol102`.

  ## Clean-Up

  After completing the steps, it's good practice to clean up the Docker resources to free up system resources.

  ```bash
  # Stop and remove all containers
  docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)

  # Remove all Docker images (use with caution)
  docker rmi $(docker images -q)

  # Remove the volumes if desired
  docker volume rm myvol101 myvol102

  # Verify that volumes are removed
  docker volume ls
  ```

  **Note:**

  - Be careful with the `docker rmi $(docker images -q)` command as it will remove all Docker images from your system.
  - Ensure you do not need the images before running this command.
  - The same applies to removing volumes. Only remove volumes that you no longer need.

  ## Conclusion

  You have successfully:

  - Understand how to create Docker volumes when starting containers.
  - Used the `--mount` flag to mount volumes into containers with explicit options.
  - Used the `-v` flag as a shorthand to mount volumes into containers.
  - Verified the volume mounts inside the containers.
  - Cleaned up Docker containers, images, and volumes.
